                  <p>What makes an organization unique is its culture. The same is true for us in ABSCBN. Our core values, reflected in our culture and the way we serve the Filipino, set us apart from other organizations.</p>
                  <p>For us in ABS-CBN, our core values serve as our anchor and guidepost. They keep us grounded and remind us of the things that matter more than ratings, revenues, and profits. They guide us in our decision-making and direct our choices and actions. Our core values, with clearly articulated behavioral indicators, define what the ABS-CBN culture is and what kind of people would thrive in our organization.</p>
